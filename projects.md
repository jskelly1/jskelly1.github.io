  <summary>250+ User Texas A and M Job Board List Serve Email Alert Bot</summary> <br>
  
| Word | Title | Url |
|---|---|---|
| Montana | range wildlife biologist | https://jobs.rwfm.tamu.edu/view-job/?id=103047 |
| Montana | wildlife management biologist |  biologist	https://jobs.rwfm.tamu.edu/view-job/?id=103052 |

Currently, I maintain a 250+ person job board list serve that sends daily emails based on custom keywords found in new Texas A and M Job Board posts. Natural resource jobs are competitive and applying and searching for jobs is not conducive to those who have less time to monitor the website daily. Instead, I hope this tool can improve accessibility to job applying.
