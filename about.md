Who am I?

I was raised in the rural hills of Western Massachusetts, where I gained strong guiding values of community, ecological importance, and value of changemaking. As a child I felt dedicated to ecology broadly, with hopes to be a naturalist. Later, as a high schooler working with the [Student Conservation Association](https://thesca.org/), I became enamored with channeling ecological understanding into conservation. I began working with local non-profits and the USFW to lobby and advocate for change within the state where I met with ecologists who inspired me. Upon graduating high school I moved to Gunnison, CO, a high-desert, sagebrush dominated rural town on the West Slope to attend Western Colorado University. There I continued to refine my guiding values of community and ecology. While I have moved a decent bit for job opportunities, I currently call Bozeman, Montana home. In 2025, I am now at Montana State University as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Department of Ecology](https://www.montana.edu/ecology/). If you would like to find out more about my research, check out research interests. In my free time I am a passionate learner; reading, trying new culinary ideas, and moving outside. Every day I am out running, skiing or biking. And of course, always with binoculars!
